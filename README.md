# tic-tac-toe
 
##Tic Tac Toe Project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

This project gave me a better insight of how to use the module pattern and the factory functions. I learnt about closures and using the scope. I also had to use `<bind()>` with my event Listener to pass my calllback. It gave me a better understanding of how `<this>` works. It was also an opportunity to learn more about the two-dimensional arrays that made it easier for me to check the winning conditions of the game.
